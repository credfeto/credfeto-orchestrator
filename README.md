# credfeto-orchestrator

Orchestrator tooling for driving Claude Code agents to work on GitHub issues and pull requests.

## oneshot

The `oneshot` script fetches the top-priority open work item for `credfeto/credfeto-orchestrator`
from the [priorities API](https://git-workflow.markridgwell.com/priorities) and invokes a
Claude Code session to work on it.  One session file is stored per issue or pull request at
`$HOME/.orchestrator/credfeto/credfeto-orchestrator/<ItemType>_<id>.env` so that subsequent
runs resume the correct Claude session.  When a PR has no session of its own the script
inherits the session from any linked closing issue.

### Usage

```sh
./oneshot
```

### Requirements

- `curl`
- `jq`
- `claude` (Claude Code CLI)
- `gh` (GitHub CLI, authenticated)

### Per-owner OAuth token

By default, the script uses whatever `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is already set in the environment.
To charge Claude usage to a specific owner's Anthropic account, create a token file for that owner.

**Preferred location (XDG):**

```text
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/orchestrator/tokens/<owner>
```

(defaults to `~/.config/orchestrator/tokens/<owner>` when `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set)

The file should contain the raw OAuth token; any surrounding whitespace is stripped automatically.
The token is scoped to the `claude` invocation via `env CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=...` and is never written to log output.

**File permissions — set `600` to prevent other users from reading the token:**

```sh
chmod 600 "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/orchestrator/tokens/<owner>"
```

Example — storing a token for the `credfeto` owner:

```sh
mkdir -p "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/orchestrator/tokens"
printf '%s' '<oauth-token>' > "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/orchestrator/tokens/credfeto"
chmod 600 "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/orchestrator/tokens/credfeto"
```

If no token file exists, the script falls back to `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from the environment,
preserving the existing behaviour for installations that do not require per-owner billing.

> **Note:** The current script is configured for the `credfeto` owner. As the orchestrator is
> extended to cover additional repos, set `OWNER` accordingly and create a token file for each owner.

### Discord webhook notifications (optional)

The script can post notifications to a Discord channel via a webhook whenever:

- An issue or PR is **picked up** (new session started or existing session resumed), with a link to the item.
- An issue or PR is found to be **blocked** (has the `Blocked` label), with a link to the item.
- **No actionable work items** are found after scanning all priorities.

To enable, add a `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` entry to the config `.env` file:

```dotenv
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>
```

**Config file location:**

```text
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/orchestrator/.env
```

(defaults to `~/.config/orchestrator/.env` when `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set)

**File permissions — set `600` to prevent other users from reading the webhook URL:**

```sh
chmod 600 "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/orchestrator/.env"
```

If `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` is absent or the file does not exist, Discord notifications are silently skipped.
